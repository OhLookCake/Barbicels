Run as a network, run two players and have them listen on ports
Can compute in offtime
 Server side
 Classes
 1. PlayerInfo
 2. Board : Allows players to interact wit board
 contains and infinite while loop: send message to players, receive message, send confirmation and "start play" to player ports. Doesnt allow players to delay.
 UniversalInterface.py

 Advantage: Reading from disk nahi lagta.

 Agent: Code not changing much
 1. Make it listen on port
 2. Listen function calls something else.
 Separate processing into
 1. Preprocess : at start
 2. Listen function: calls "intelligent" code.
 3. Listen + preprocess, ye dekho. (2nd iteration)

 Plan: rewrite Universal Interface, rewrite

Why?

Greedy agent
2.  What is an anchor constraint?
